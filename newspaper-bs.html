          </h2>
          <p class="col-md-12  col-xs-12">Motivation is a powerful, yet tricky beast. Sometimes it is
            really easy to get motivated, and you
            find yourself wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement. Other times, it is nearly impossible
            to
            figure out how to motivate yourself and you're trapped in a death spiral of
            procrastination. This
            page contains the best ideas and most useful research on how to get and stay motivated.

            This isn't going to be some rah-rah, pumped-up motivational speech. (That's not my style.)
            Instead,
            we're going to break down the science behind how to get motivated in the first place and
            how to
            stay motivated for the long-run. Whether you're trying to figure out how to motivate
            yourself or
            how to motivate a team, this page should cover everything you need to know.

          <h2 class="col-md-12  col-xs-12">What is Creativity?</h2>
          <p class="col-md-12  col-xs-12">The creative process is the act of making new connections
            between old ideas or recognizing
            relationships between concepts. Creative thinking is not about generating something new
            from a
            blank slate, but rather about taking what is already present and combining those bits and
            pieces in
            a way that has not been done previously.
            While being creative isn't easy, nearly all great ideas follow a similar creative process.
            In 1940,
            an advertising executive named James Webb Young published a short guide titled, A Technique
            for
            Producing Ideas.

            <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12 mainhead-para"> HUNDREDS of flights and train services have been
              cancelled or suspended on mainland Japan, as the
              nation prepares for the landfall of Typhoon Trami on Sunday.
              Kansai International Airport in Osaka announced that its runways were closed as of 11am
              local time (3am
              BST) on Sunday and will not reopen until 6am on Monday (10pm BST).<br>

              The airport only reopened on September 21 after the last typhoon hit the region.

              NHK news agency reported that airlines have either cancelled or plan to cancel over 930
              flights over the
              weekend.

              Most local trains and bullet trains in the west of the country have also suspended
              operations on Sunday,
              according to West Japan Railway.<br>
              The storm is equally having a direct impact on local populations, after around 700,000
              households were
              issued evacuation warnings in south and west Japan.

              In southern Okinawa and Kagoshima provinces, more than 300,000 households have lost power.

              Almost 50 people have been injured in this area as well.

              The storm is currently Category 2, and has a similar path to Typhoon Jebi, which was the
              most powerful to
              hit Japan in 25 years.

                A Bengaluru investment firm, MorgenAll Co-operative Society run by Maqdooma Fathima and

                husband Irfan Pasha (in pic) in Horamavu Main Road, has allegedly cheated hundreds of

                Investors had been lured in with the promise of attractive profits and started
                complaining when
                returns were not as expected. To their dismay, they found that the couple had closed
                down the
                company on Monday. Investors allege that the owners cannot be traced.

              <h3>How hunger affects your stress levels</h3>
              <p> New Delhi: There is evidence that a change in blood glucose level can have a lasting
                effect on
                mood. Now, a research published in the journal Psychopharmacology has found a link
                between
                metabolic changes, negative mood states and anxiety. The researchers found that a
                sudden drop
                in glucose when you are hungry can have a negative impact on your mood.

                The main aim of this research was to investigate whether chronic, long-term
                hypoglycemia or low
                blood sugar is a risk factor for developing depression-like behaviours. The study
                examined the
                impact of a sudden glucose drop on emotional behaviour by inducing hypoglycemia in
                rats. “We
                found evidence that a change in glucose level can have a lasting effect on mood,” said
                Professor Francesco Leri from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.
